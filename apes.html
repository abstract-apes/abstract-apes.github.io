								<p>The only guy I know that deconstructs his own empathy towards other people and isn’t a sociopath (I think?). Values his time but will always cover for you. Doesn’t want to kill off all the old people. (so kind! I told you, not a sociopath.) Sexy. (what?) Asks good questions to make sure he understands you because he cares about your arguments. (and feelings!) He’s got the hustle in him but is also wise enough to know that there’s more important stuff than the hustle. Serial money saver but will not cheap out when it comes to experiences. Will explain to you how light works. (just ask) His brain is an informational black hole and weighs around 1350 grams. (yours too, probably) Acknowledges his emotions but prefers to self-reflect first to process them. (the brain emojis) Anyway. Overall cool guy. Lives fast, feels strong and loves people. </p>

								<h1 >Penev</h1>
								<hr class="major">
								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>A true monkey mind by heart, Penev is always up for abstract conversations that fulfill his drive for intellectual and emotional insights.
									The most disagreeable person I know, we can argue all day (talking from experience here) and by the end have no idea what we’re even arguing about. 
									His curiosity and skepticism have always struck me to be sky high. If he finds something interesting, he will get sucked into a productive black hole for days until he feels he has the job done.
									Small talk is not his strong suit, so expect a “what do you think is the meaning of life?” on a first date with him. His authenticity is something I deeply admire and strive towards.</p>
